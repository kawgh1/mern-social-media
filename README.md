-   # MERN Stack Social Media App w/ Socket.io
-   This project is based on a MERN course by Lama Dev. I added a lot of custom styling, layout and functionality including the entire responsive mobile view and the Heroku deployment.

### After Action Review

-   This was a great project. I learned a lot. I learned about implementing Socket IO and ran a MERN stack with MongoDB and Node API.

-   There are still many visual/functional improvements that could be made, but I mostly wanted to get a working Social Media type clone using the MERN stack up and running.

-   I also wanted to have more fun with the project and opted for some more creative styling than normal. Most social media apps are a bit flat these days.

-   I like some color and texture.

-   Each folder has its own README with more info for each
